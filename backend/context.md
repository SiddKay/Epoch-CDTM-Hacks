This is a backend for our patient document project, written in FastAPI. It currently provides one endpoint:

POST /upload-image
- Accepts an image upload
- Runs the image through a placeholder function that returns dummy text and key points
- Saves the image, text, and key points to Supabase (currently a placeholder function)

- Replace placeholder extraction logic with real image/text processing
- Add error handling and validation
